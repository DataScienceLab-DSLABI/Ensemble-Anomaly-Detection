Ensemble Anomaly Detection

# Overview:
This project develops an ensemble approach for robust anomaly management in complex system monitoring. Various unsupervised learning algorithms are trained on distributed feature spaces and temporal windows to produce a collection of base anomaly detectors. Model inferences are aggregated through techniques like voting and stacking to produce meta-predictions. The outcomes provide reliable anomaly coverage through synergistic consensus between diverse, independent detectors.
